# Project Overiview

Our solution is an Autonomous Vital Monitoring Robot designed to navigate hospital settings, read patient vitals (such as heart rate), and store this data on a website for real-time access by doctors. Its primary goal is to reduce the workload of overburdened healthcare professionals in impoverished countries, ensuring timely and consistent patient monitoring, which is crucial for improving health outcomes.

# Dashboard
That sounds like a great application for healthcare automation! If you want feedback or improvements, I can review your UI code. Do you need help with features like real-time patient detection, database integration, or enhancing the user interface for better usability?
